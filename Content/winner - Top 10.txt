Quick Tips for winning penny auctions cheap

1) Stock up on credits when sites have offers, never buy credits full price. You can find some helpful information on how to stock up on credits here.

2) Never bid on auctions that are likely to lower your ability to win (cheaper or smaller products that are not worth your while)

3) Recommend friends to get a referral bonus.

4) Work out an average closing price based on day and time for various products

5) Work out constant bidders and winners by sifting through auctions

6) Work out bidding patterns of bigger winners, if they are after a certain product and are willing to suffer a loss, steer clear of such opponents

7) Collect at least 3000 credits cheaply before bidding

8) Work an upper limit for your credits used while bidding on an auction. Remember to set yourself an upper limit, remember to buy the product if you have reached your upper limit or convert them back to credits.
