<h2>How do Penny Auctions work?</h2>

<p>
Penny auctions differ from normal auction sites like eBay. At eBay, products have a cerain minimum price and the products sold on the site by users are usually used items. Sites like <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=U0BEgoGrFzE&offerid=201595.10000058&type=1&subid=0&LSNSUBSITE=subsite">Beezid.com</a> or MadBid on the other hand ALWAYS ship brand new products! While on eBay, you might get offered products from users who have used an iPhone for example, sites like <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=U0BEgoGrFzE&offerid=201595.10000058&type=1&subid=0&LSNSUBSITE=subsite">Beezid.com</a> or MadBid always offer packaged items along with the warranty. The key difference here is the way the business operates. Penny auctions are usually pay to bid auctions. That is, users pay for every bid placed. But the upside is that the price of the item goes up by a penny or cent. So even if you bid 10 times, the price of the product doesn't go up by a lot. Uusally products like iPhones sell for around £60.

Now that you have an idea on how penny auctions work, here is an anatomy of the process and how the business makes money out of the whole process. Even though the item price goes up by a single euro cent / cent or penny, users bid on the auction using virtual money or credits. You'll need to purchase this virtual currency on the site itself. Typically you can buy a bid package for £9.99 giving you 80 credits on MadBid or, 30 bids for $27.99 on <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=U0BEgoGrFzE&offerid=201595.10000058&type=1&subid=0&LSNSUBSITE=subsite">Beezid.com</a>.

<p>
Let's use MadBid as an example:
At 9.99 / 80 ( ~ 12 pence ), a normal iPhone is charged for 6 credits per bid. So you are spending approximately 72 pence per bid. If you think about it, this isn't a lot. It is the same as paying for a half a lottery ticket where the chances of winning solely depend on your luck. Penny auctions however, can be won using a little bit of observation and also by bidding smartly. Checkout the <a href="/penny-auction-bidding-strategies.html">bidding strategies</a> section on <a href="/penny-auction-bidding-strategies.html">how to win penny auctions cheaply</a> for an insight.

Of course the company makes a lot of money, on an average, if an iphone 5 is sold for a final price of £60, this makes the company a net profit of 60 * 100 * 6 * .012 - 599 =  £3721. This is a massive 620% profit for the company. However, you could imagine most of this going into keeping the site alive. Nevertheless, penny auctions are definitely worth a try, especially when they give you a buy option. More about the buy option below.

<h2>What is Bid or Buy option</h2>
<p>
Many sites like MadBid and <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=U0BEgoGrFzE&offerid=201595.10000058&type=1&subid=0&LSNSUBSITE=subsite">Beezid.com</a> offer a bid or buy model to give users a chance to play and win the product or simply buy the product. Let me take you through the steps using an example. If the product you were bidding on closed and you failed to win after spending around £100 pounds on bidding, you have the chance to buy the product at price of the product - £100 (the money you spent on bidding). As an example, for an iPhone priced at £599, you get £100 pounds off and you can now buy the product for £499, cheaper than the market price!

I usually recommend this to new users. Since you planned on buying a product anyway, no harm in trying to win the product cheap right? Concentrate on a single product and then buy bids worth the product price itself. So say you want to win an iPhone, why not try by buying credits worth £500? Then you go about winning bid packages, and then if you don't win, you get the iPhone next to nothing.
