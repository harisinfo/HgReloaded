<h2>Why pay full price?</h2>
<p>
Hi there winner,<br />
welcome to the #1 resource for reviewing penny auctions and, learn tips, techniques and strategies on how to win penny auctions cheaply. After investing a considerable amount of time, money and effort and, having amased a wealth of knowledge in online auctions and penny auctions, I've finally decided to share this knowledge I have gathered over the past few years. Penny auctions have taken the UK and Europe by storm. At the moment, Europe has over 500 Penny Auction sites running. Some big names have opened and closed their shop (Swoopo) owing to high operating costs. Others are still going strong, likes of Beezid.com, MadBid.com, QuiBids are still shipping out brand new cheap products like iPhone 5s, iMac, Kindle, Samsung Galaxy and more to 100s of winners everyday. 
<br />You can get products like iPhones / iPads / Laptops for 5% of their retail price! That is a massive 95% saving. Of course you will get a lot of opinions stating that this is a scam or the winners are lucky. But contrary to popular believe, sites like Beezid.com or MadBid are not scams at all. I have used both sites and a host of others and have won over 100 products till date. These include iPhones, iPads, Kindles, XBox and much more. However, I will warn you of one thing, like most new users, if you don't know what you are doing, you are likely to fall into a trap. It is not the site which is the scam but how users get sucked into a tonne of information on the sites. I will cut through all the noise and if you follow step-by-step information on how to go about bidding on these sites, you will have a massive advantage over most of the others.

<h2>About my penny auction experience</h2>
<p>
Why listen to me? For starters, I have worked for one on the world's largest penny auction sites for over 3 years and, have analysed over a million users bidding against each other. I know exactly how and what the winning users do to differentiate themselves from the losers. Once I left the company, I then started using this knowledge to my use. Not surprisingly, I managed to win on almost any legitimate penny auction site. Warning! Always research the penny auction site you are going to use, and always signup to at least a couple of them to increase your chances. It is not a game of luck but rather a game of careful analysis. I am surprised many compare penny auctions to gambling. Penny auctions are anything but gambling. Penny auctions require careful analysis, knowing when to bid and having enough data to hand. And yes, I have won iPhones, iPads, Laptops, xBox consoles, Kindles and 2 TVs till date.
