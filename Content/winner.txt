FAQs

Question 1) So, are pay to bid sites a scam? 

Answer) No, they are not. You pay for every bid you place since the price of the auctions start at 0.00. Every bid you make, the price goes up by a penny or cent. Of course the profit pay to bid sites make is huge, but remember technology for running an auction site doesn't come cheap. How do I know all of this? Well, I worked for one before so you can rest assure a lot of stuff in here is worth it's weight in gold.

Question 2) Statistically, I can see an iPhone 4 sold for as low as 99pence/cent and also it sold for GBP75.00. Does this information help?

Answer) Yes, it helps if you know the complete history of the particular auction. You need to analyse when did the auction start, how many credits you placed, ther users bidding on it etc. Most new users start out by bidding on an iPhone or any other Apple product. Wrong! This is the catch. You are sucked into the big auction and yes, they have big players who will out muscle every one of you. More information on how to out think your bidding rivals is on the vault.


Question 3) Are pay to bid auction sites like MadBid considered gambling?

Answer) Contrary to popular belief, they are not. The site makes money per bid placed. Each bid comprises a set of credits. Credits have a value (or can be free) based on the package purchased. Typically a bid package would cost 27.99 for 275 credits on MadBid. Or, if you decide to sign up right now, you can get 550 credits for £27.99! That is a massive double up bonus offer.


Question 4) Do ordinary people really win?

Answer) Yes, ordinary people WIN! Anyone can win. The only question is are you willing to spend time and a little bit of your money smartly to become a winner on pay to bid sites. MadBid ships at least 5 brand new iPhones a week and 100s of other products including Apple iMac, Amazon Kindle, Samsung Galaxy, Dell Laptop, Acer Ultrabook, LG Flat Screen HD TV and more. Check some of these guys out, they have won a brand new Mini for £6.00! That is a bargain hard to beat anywhere on this planet. Or checkout this video from the BBC, needless to say, people are winning on pay to bid auction sites like MadBid!


Question 5) Whom do you recommend amongst all pay to bid sites and why?

Answer) I would say MadBid. I have tried It is a safe option. Why? On most of the products you can use a Buy Now option to recover the credits lost. So say you spent £200 on an auction and decided to quit. You've upto 7 days to buy the product even if you didn't win and claim it towards a buy now discount. So if the product cost £400 and you spent £200, You get the product by paying an additional £200. It is a way of minimising your loss.


Question 6) Are these products refurbished?

Answer) No, the products you win in auctions are absolutely brand new, packaged, with waranty and all! What else do you need?


Question 7) OK, I am ready to win, give me more!

Strategy Part 1

Welcome back! The good news is that you have a number of pay to bid auction sites springing up everyday and, what works on one site works on the others too. The bad news is, you have a number of these that are out to scam you and con you if you are not careful. To make life easier for the average user, I have created a report section where I hand pick online auction sites for new users to try. I also discuss the highs and lows of various online auction sites in this section. Since everything is manually checked, it takes some time for me to produce a report. Be sure to signup for my newsletter updates so that I can send you important information on how to win online auctions.


Don't skip through the intro, every word here is important if you want to win online auctions. I would recommend you to go through this if you want to become an online auction king. 

Understanding the average Joe

A normal user who lands at an online auction site like MadBid is looking to win an iPhone for 1p. Ain't gonna happen unless it was the end of the world! But why? Generally users who land up on MadBid are people who have been searching over the Internet to buy a cheap iPhone instantly. Yes, we all want one of these but let us build our capital first. It is the same as money, if you spend what you don't have, you will help make someone else richer. The discipline is to have enough to be able to win the product you want. On an average, a user on MadBid is in competition with some pretty big users, and they will try and out muscle you. To match them, you must have enough credits in your account. Even if it is not a lot, it should be enough to help you win provided you follow the steps below.


So here is the strategy


If you have already bought yourself a credit package at MadBid skip steps 1 through 4


1) Once you have registered, you are probably looking at the buy page. Scroll right to the bottom to see your package options. I don't understand the idea of having a long page, personally I think the idea of a long scrolling buy page sucks.

2) It is always worth buying credits for £30.00 or above. It is a safe option and assuming you are doing it within the first 24 hours of signing up, you are going to get 100% extra credits FREE!! That is a bargain.

3) WARNING!! Now here is the sneaky bit, on the payment details page, remember to UNCHECK both the tick boxes (the one for saving your card information and the second one for Rapid Recharge). The Rapid Recharge features allows you to instantly topup your account when you are bidding on auctions when your credit falls below 20. It is limited to £100 a day but can leave you with a hole in your pocket if you are not careful.

4) On the confirmation of your payment page, click on the link to start bidding on auctions. This should take you to the Guided Auctions page. I think this is a good feature showing users the different options they have. However read the next step before you bid on anything

5) If you can't see a 75 credit package on this list, do not bother bidding on any of the auctions. You are going to get sucked in and will not win anything. Click on Go to live auctions instead.

6) Switch to easy view, this will show you all the available auctions on the site. Also keep a track of the time when you bid on auctions. Usually early mornings and Fridays are less busy and you are more likely to win.

7) This is the most important step: start with the 75 MadBid credits and win as many as you can. MadBid allows you upto 3 wins a day. This will give you enough credits in your account to start with. Do not waste your time with smaller items, you will be spending your daily winning limits. Try to win at least 20 of these.

8) Accumulate free credits. Join the MadBid Fan page on Facebook. They usually have promotional surveys which will help you gain free credits.

9) Rewind - rinse - repeat. Keep doing this till you have a substantial amount of credits. 

10) Your goal is to get as many as 10000 credits using offers and winning auctions.




Graduating to winning bigger auctions - Strategy Part 2

Winning bigger auctions are a completely different league. However, remember you need to have substantial credits in your account. If you are planing to win an iPhone, prepare to know that you already have around 2000 credits in your account. Does this guarantee a win, no but it gives you a better chance than most other suckers out there. On an average, users spend around 2000 credits before they finally give up trying to win an iPhone. Timing is all you need. 

1) Gauge the true cost of your credits. If you have been following the tutorial so far, the average value of your credits should be 0.075 per credit. With 2000 credits your value of credits are 150. Now here is the trick if you are "rich" you can out-muscle any oponent. Refer to the final price section to view a table of products that have sold cheaply at these auction sites.

2) Place bids only when the auction reaches 90% of maximum value. So if an iPhone has a final price of £20, start bidding at 18. Be random and watch patters where users are repeating themselves
