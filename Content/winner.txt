Hi there winner,

If you are looking to buy a brand new cheap iPhone, cheap iMac, cheap Samsung Galaxy, cheap Amazon Kindle, xBox, a brand new Ultrabook or any brand new fresh out of the box technology product, you have come to the right spot. 

Just so that you know I've worked for one of the world's largest online auction sites for over 2 years and am a regular user on at least 3 others as a part of my research. In all I have won over 300 products on other sites using some simple techniques that I would like to share with you. Read through all the details and I'll teach you tips / techniques on how to go about winning the iPhone 5 you've always wanted. Why just an iPhone, with time you will know the low down techniques on how to out-bid your rivals and, get the product that YOU have always wanted. The good news is that you have a number of pay to bid auction sites springing up in the EU everyday and what works on one site more or less works on the others too. You will get the same bidders on these sites usually with the same usernames. Word of caution, always read reviews before signing up to new online auction sites. Some of them will scam you pretty bad.



Before you know what you are getting into, let us go through the massive list of speculations out there about pay to bid sites.


Question 1) So, are pay to bid sites a scam? 

Answer) No, they are not. The idea is that you pay for every bid you place since the price of the auctions start at £0.00. Every bid you make, the price goes up by a penny. Of course the profit pay to bid sites make is a lot, but remember technology for this doesn't come cheap. Most of the money made is spent on their various activities. How do I know all of this? Well, I worked for one before so you can rest assure a lot of stuff in here is worth it's weight in gold.

Question 2) Statistically, I can see an iPhone 4 sold for as low as 99p and also it sold for £75.00. Does this information help?

Answer) Yes, it helps if you know the complete history of the particular auction. When did it start, how many credits you placed, ther users bidding on it etc. Most new users start out by bidding on an iPhone or any other Apple product. Wrong! This is the catch. You are sucked into the big auction and yes, they have big players who will out muscle every one of you. More information on how to out think your bidding rivals is on the vault.


Question 3) Are sites like MadBid gambling?

Answer) Contrary to popular belief, they are not. The site makes money per bid placed. Each bid comprises a set of credits. Credits have a value (or can be free) based on the package purchased. Typically a bid package would cost 27.99 for 275 credits ON MadBid. Or, if you decide to sign up right now, you can get 550 credits for £27.99! That is a massive double up bonus offer. More about using offers later.


Question 4) Do ordinary people really win?

Answer) Yes, ordinary people WIN! Anyone can win. The only question is are you willing to spend time and a little bit of your money smartly to become a winner on pay to bid sites. MadBid ships at least 5 brand new iPhones a week and 100s of other products including Appli iMac, Kindles, Samsung Galaxy, Dell Laptops, Acer Ultrabooks, LG Flat Screen HD TVs and more. Check some of these guys out, they have won Cars for £6.00. Checkout this video from the BBC, needless to say, people are winning on madbid!


Question 5) Whom do you recommend amongst all pay to bid sites and why?

Answer) I would say MadBid. It is a safe option. Why? On most of the products you can use a Buy Now option to recover the credits lost. So say you spent £200 on an auction and decided to quit. You've upto 7 days to buy the product even if you didn't win and claim it towards a buy now discount. So if the product cost £400 and you spent £200, You get the product by paying an additional £200. It is a way of minimising your loss.


Question 6) Are these products refurbished?

Answer) No, the products you win in auctions are absolutely brand new, packaged, with waranty and all! What else do you need?


Question 7) OK, I am ready to win, give me more!

Answer) Since you've come so far it is time to dig in. If you think you are ready and want to start winning, click here and get an additional 100% extra credits! Remember to come back and follow the step by step rules before you get sucked into spending your bids. The techniques are FREE!!

Welcome back, now you are ready to become a winner. If you skip through the intro and scroll down to the techniques you are going to miss out on all the important information. I would recommend you to go through this if you want to become a pay to bid king. So what is the single trait that will help you succeed, delaying your need to bid on the iPhone or any other big auction. Remember if you are planing to win on pay to bid online auctions. But why not bid if that was my aim in the first place? For this you need to understand how normal users think.

Understanding the average Joe

A normal user who lands at MadBid or any other auction site for that matter is looking to win an iPhone for 1p. Ain't gonna happen unless it was the end of the world! But why? Generally users who land up on MadBid are people who have been searching over the Internet to buy a cheap iPhone instantly. Yes, we all want one of these but let us build our capital first. It is the same as money, if you spend what you don't have, you will help make someone else richer. The discipline is to have enough to be able to win the product you want. On an average, a user on MadBid is in competition with some pretty big users, and they will try and out muscle you. To match them, you must have enough credits in your account. Even if it is not a lot, it should be enough to help you win provided you follow the steps below.


So here is the strategy


If you have already bought yourself a credit package at MadBid skip steps 1 through 4


1) Once you have registered, you are probably looking at the buy page. Scroll right to the bottom to see your package options. I don't understand the idea of having a long page, personally I think the idea of a long scrolling buy page sucks.

2) It is always worth buying credits for £30.00 or above. It is a safe option and assuming you are doing it within the first 24 hours of signing up, you are going to get 100% extra credits FREE!! That is a bargain.

3) WARNING!! Now here is the sneaky bit, on the payment details page, remember to UNCHECK both the tick boxes (the one for saving your card information and the second one for Rapid Recharge). The Rapid Recharge features allows you to instantly topup your account when you are bidding on auctions when your credit falls below 20. It is limited to £100 a day but can leave you with a hole in your pocket if you are not careful.

4) On the confirmation of your payment page, click on the link to start bidding on auctions. This should take you to the Guided Auctions page. I think this is a good feature showing users the different options they have. However read the next step before you bid on anything

5) If you can't see a 75 credit package on this list, do not bid on any auction. You are going to get sucked in and will not win anything. Click on Go to live auctions instead.

6) Switch to easy view, this will show you all the available auctions on the site. Also keep a track of the time when you bid on auctions. Usually mornings and Fridays are less busy.

7) Important: start with the 75 MadBid credits and win as many as you can. MadBid allows you upto 3 wins a day. This will give you enough credits in your account to start with. Do not waste your time with smaller 

8) Accumulate free credits. Join the MadBid Fan page on Facebook. They usually have promotional surveys which will help you gain free credits.

9) Rewind - rinse - repeat. Keep doing this till you have a substantial amount of credits. 




Graduating to winning bigger auctions

Winning bigger auctions are a completely different league. However, remember you need to have substantial credits in the system. If you are planing to win an iPhone, prepare to know that you already have around 1500 credits in your account. Does this guarantee a win, no but it gives you a better chance than most
